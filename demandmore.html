                <p class="mb-5 mb-md-3">Everyone wants more from life me included, but what I have noticed is people striving and struggling to get the things they want. Frustrated and unable to bring around the change they want they give up before they ever really get going, until the lack of what they want resurfaces and the loop of struggle and frustration starts again.</p>
                <p class="mb-5 mb-md-3">People turn to the world of self help and personal development where there are so many people with good advice ready to help, there are posts, pictures, memes and videos. There is so much advice and lots of good, but in this noise it’s hard to know what to apply and what to do, so people like and consume the content never really applying any of it. People get frustrated again because the results still aren’t coming.</p>
                <p class="mb-5 mb-md-3">Results lie in taking action, getting the results you want and moving forward faster lies in taking the right action. I believe anybody is capable of absolutely anything, but you have to get strategic about getting the things you want, change the things you are doing slight and allow your mind to approach the problem from a different paradigm.</p>
                <p class="mb-3 mb-md-5 mb-md-3">To do that I created my DEMAND MORE methodology, I use it like a map to help myself and the people I work with close the gap between where they are now and where they want to be. It embodies everything I have learnt about personal development and provides a strategy to get what you want faster.</p>

                  <h3 class="mb-4">DECIDE</h3>
                  <p>This step is so important and must be done first, if you don’t know exactly what it is you want you face a frustrating uphill battle. Don’t expect change and to move forward without knowing where you want to go.</p>
                  <p>You have to get crystal clear about what you want, when you know that you can really get to work on bringing it into your life. Don’t confuse knowing what you don’t want as thinking you know what you do want, pushing away is not the same as pulling towards. Your mind concentrates on whatever it is that you feed it. Concentrating on what you don’t want, not
                  having enough money or not wanting a boring 9-5 life will just bring more of that.</p>
                  <p>When you decide and get clarity around your future a sense of calm sets in the frustration dies down and you can get to work bringing about the future you want. When you decide on your goal you can put a strategy together, and finally gain some control.</p>
                  <p class="mb-0">Deciding is the first step to making things happen and moving forward to the life you want</p>

                  <h3 class="color-pink mb-4">EMPOWER</h3>
                  <p>If you do not empower your goal the chances of you reaching it are slim and the
                  chance of reaching it quickly are even slimmer. Getting the good stuff in life often can be
                  difficult require sacrifice and usually a decent amount of action. All that can be tough,
                  especially when the friction of life gets in the way with what we really want. If you are not
                  clear about why you are doing the things you are doing and making the sacrifices you are
                  making then chances of failure are high.</p>
                  <p>Your goal needs to be a 10/10 must have and not a 6/10 nice to have. When you empower your goal, when you know why you are doing something, why you want it, who gains to benefit from it and what the reality of the end prize looks like your chances of actually staying the course and really getting there this time sky rocket.</p>
                  <p>Empower yourself to get the things you want.</p>

                  <p>We want to create a strategy so we know exactly what to do to get from where we are now to where we want to be. We don’t want to waste time, so don’t leave things to chance, you need to be strategic and create a winning plan.</p>
                  <p>Work backwards, reverse engineer what you want, start with the end goal and create a map of how go from where you are now to where we you want to be.</p>

                  <p>Getting to where you want to be will ultimately be determined by the action you take.
                  Specifically the amount of action and the appropriateness of that action. The steps I lay out in this process are all designed to make sure you take the right action and that you are motivated and set up to take enough action to create the things you want.</p>
                  <p>You can make as many vision boards as you like, write your goals down everyday and do as much meditation as you want, but the bottom line is that they are useless exercises unless you take action. The things you want, and the life you crave won’t just fall into your lap. All these tools are designed to help you take action, the right action.</p>
                  <p>Action is what will separate success from failure.</p>

                  <p>I believe that we are our own biggest block from getting the things we want. If we can’t get a handle on controlling our own thoughts then even with all the other steps in place we will find that we come up short time and time again.</p>
                  <p>We need to navigate through our own mind, action is what will get us the things we want but our thoughts control the actions we take.</p>
                  <p>If you want something different in your live, a new destination to arrive at then we are going
                  to have to re write those old truths and replace them with beliefs that serve you better.</p>

                  <p>All success come from completed tasks.</p>
                  <p>If you want to move forward and reach your goals you have to see things through, making change and creating something new in your life can be difficult, but people often give up to quickly. People all too often give up when what they want is so much closer than they think. They pick up the next shiny object and give that a go, don’t see that through either and never
                  really make any progress.</p>
                  <p>You have to break this cycle and do it until it’s done, the way to do this is through
                  accountability and creating successful habits.</p>
