              <p class="mb-4">In my early life, I was lucky enough to be almost brainwashed into believing that I was special and could achieve anything. The only problem with believing this is was I almost took it for granted and just believed that I was destined for great things never really usguring out what the great things I was meant to be doing were.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">I drifted through life and went to University because I didn’t really know what else I was supposed to do. I was under the illusion that I’d come away with all the skills I needed to be successful and live a large, exciting, proustable life. What actually happened was that I came away feeling more lost, frustrated and still didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. I fell in to sales and while it was usnancially rewarding and I should have been happy just wasn’t, I knew I had more to orser the world and didn’t feel any purpose or passion, for me I wasgsoating through life and not really living it, I felt I<br>
              had so much more potential.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">So I quit and spent lots of time and mistakes trying so many dirserent things and I’d gone so far backward that for a short time I thought I might never usnd my purpose. I’d become unskilled and without passion or purpose and thought I’d always just be a dreamer who would never reach his potential. Decided I needed a skill, something that could help people, be useful and always be of value. I retrained and became an electrician, this was no easy feat at the age of 26 but it gave me a clear path and an end goal. It was great to know that whatever big dreams I had that I could always try them and if they didn’t work out I’d always have this to fall back on. But when you’re ambitious and have big goals settling never works out for the best and doesn’t make you happy.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">During this time I started reading about personal development, in fact, I did more than read I studied it and learned everything I could. Through this, the desire and excitement for a massive life grew again. I became obsessed withusnding my purpose and what would excite me to get out of bed every day. While I enjoyed my work as an electrician it always felt like just that, work. I wanted more, I wanted the dream life, I wanted to live on purpose with purpose and passion.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">I used every tool and technique I had studied and started to apply them to my life and tried new things. I became bolder and braver with everything I did and tried. Whether I failed or succeeded I felt like I was getting closer.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">I was taking a marketing course to help grow my site that connected electricians with potential customers when a topic of passion and purpose came up. The teacher was explaining how he had been wanting to publish about something but he didn’t know what. He had spent sleepless nights just not knowing what he could publish about. Even though he had spent the last few years every spare minute he had learning about the stock market. At this moment it hit me like a tonne of bricks and I had this compelling knowing that personal development and helping people believe what I knew to be true, that anyone could achieve anything and live the life of their dreams was what I had to do.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">From this moment I knew what I had to do – usnd a way to give people the tools and the mindset I had learned that could drastically change your life. To make the most out of this short exciting experience we call life.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">I became obsessed with coaching and immersed myself in it and studied more personal development and applied it even more to myself and to clients. I wanted to be the best version of me I could possibly be and help as many people as physically possible to live the lives of their dreams and do exactly what it is they should be doing.</p>
              <p class="mb-5">I wanted things to happen even faster so I invested heavily and got myself a coach, a mentor and that’s when things really took ors for me. Now I’m here all usred up and ready to help you live the life you truly want and deserve – you know the one that only happens to other people. I’m here to tell you that you can have it and I can help you get it.</p>
